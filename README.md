</div>

# Griffin IDE

Griffin IDE is a specialized fork of Eclipse Theia optimized for data scientists with a focus on Bayesian statistics. It provides an integrated development environment that combines code editing, plot visualization, and Python integration in a 4-quadrant interface similar to Spyder IDE.

## Key Features

### 4-Quadrant Layout
Griffin IDE implements a quadrant-based interface optimized for data science workflows:

- **Top-Left**: Code Editor with Python syntax highlighting and intelligent code completion
- **Top-Right**: Plot Visualization panel for displaying statistical outputs and data visualizations
- **Bottom-Left**: File Explorer for project management and navigation
- **Bottom-Right**: Python Console with rich output support for executing code and viewing results

### Python Integration
- Desktop Python kernel with focus on Bayesian statistics libraries
- Rich output visualization (HTML, images, plots, LaTeX equations)
- Variable explorer for inspecting Python objects
- Support for key data science and Bayesian libraries:
  - PyMC for Bayesian statistical modeling
  - ArviZ for statistical visualization
  - NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy for data manipulation
  - TensorFlow Probability for probabilistic models
  - Altair for declarative visualization
  - Xarray for labeled multi-dimensional arrays

### Specialized for Bayesian Statistics
- Special rendering for posterior distribution plots
- Support for MCMC diagnostics visualization
- Optimized display of statistical data structures
- Integration with key Bayesian modeling tools

### Visual Customization
- Custom Griffin color scheme and branding
- Optimized UI for data science workflows
- Configurable appearance and layout
